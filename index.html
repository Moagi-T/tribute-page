            <p>Maya Angelou was an acclaimed American poet, memoirist, and civil rights activist, best known for her
                autobiographical works, particularly I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, which recounts her experiences
                growing up in the segregated South. Born in 1928, Angelou’s life spanned a wide range of roles,
                including being a dancer, singer, and director. Her powerful writing and poetry, often focused on themes
                of identity, resilience, and social justice, earned her numerous accolades, including the Presidential
                Medal of Freedom. Angelou’s voice became iconic in both the literary and social realms, and she
                continues to be celebrated for her profound impact on literature and activism.</p>
